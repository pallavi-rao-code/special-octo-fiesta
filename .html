 	<h1> The Basics </h1>
    	<p> So there are a few things that we want to keep in mind when we take photos. 
           <ol>
              <li> Shutter Speed </li>
              <li> ISO </li>
              <li> Exposure </li>
              <li> aperture </li> 
              <li> focus </li>
           </ol> 
           </ol> once you have these, you're ready to start
      </p>
  <h3> Shutter Speed </h3>
      <p> If you don't know what the shutter it's a device located on the inside of the camera which covers the image sensor <br> The shutter speed is the speed at which that device moves. <br>  You use a higher shutter speed for things that move faster or are in motion and a lower shutter speed for stationary. They also affect if you have an over or underexposed photo but you can fix that with exposure.
